# Human_Activity_Detection

Welcome to Human Activity Detection (HAD)! This innovative system leverages the compact power of the Arduino Nano 33 IoT for real-time sensor data acquisition, seamlessly transmitting it to a robust backend server. Here, a sophisticated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network processes the incoming data, providing instant, accurate predictions of human activities.

Whether it's for smart home applications, fitness tracking, elder care, or security, this project offers a versatile and scalable solution for understanding human motion in real-time.

ðŸš€ Key Features

--> Real-time Data Acquisition: Utilizes the Arduino Nano 33 IoT's integrated IMU (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) for high-frequency, real-time motion data collection.

--> Efficient Data Transmission: Leverages the on-board u-blox NINA-W102 on Arduino Nano 33 Iot for efficient communication with the server.

--> THE LSTM Model: A pre-trained, robust LSTM model hosted on the server for intelligent activity classification.

--> Instant Predictions: Experience near-instantaneous activity predictions, enabling dynamic and responsive applications.
